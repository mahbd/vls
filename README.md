# Web Vulnerability Showcase Portal

This project is an interactive educational tool designed for developers and security learners. It demonstrates common web vulnerabilities like SQL Injection (SQLi) and Cross-Site Scripting (XSS) in a controlled environment. Users can toggle between "vulnerable" and "secure" modes to see exploits in action and understand how to mitigate them.

---

## Key Features

* **SQLi Demo**: An interactive login form that is vulnerable to SQL Injection.
* **XSS Demo**: A comment box susceptible to stored Cross-Site Scripting.
* **Vulnerable/Secure Toggle**: Switch between vulnerable and secured versions of the forms to compare behavior.
* **Secure Implementations**: Demonstrates the use of prepared statements (via Prisma) and Content Security Policy (CSP) headers to prevent these attacks.
* **API Logging**: Attempts to exploit the system are logged for educational review.

## Technologies Used

* **Framework**: Next.js
* **Styling**: Tailwind CSS
* **UI Components**: shadcn/ui
* **Database**: SQLite
* **ORM**: Prisma
* **Language**: TypeScript

## How to Run Locally

1.  **Clone the repository**:
    ```bash
    git clone [https://github.com/your-username/your-repo-name.git](https://github.com/your-username/your-repo-name.git)
    cd your-repo-name
    ```

2.  **Install dependencies**:
    ```bash
    npm install
    ```

3.  **Set up the database**:
    ```bash
    npx prisma migrate dev --name init
    ```
    This will create the `dev.db` SQLite file and set up the necessary tables. You can optionally run `npx prisma db seed` if you create a seed file.

4.  **Run the development server**:
    ```bash
    npm run dev
    ```

Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) in your browser to see the application.

## API Overview

### Authentication

* `POST /api/auth/login-vulnerable`
    * Logs a user in using a raw SQL query. **Vulnerable to SQLi.**
    * **Body**: `{ "username": "admin", "password": "' OR '1'='1" }`
    * **Security Features**: Logs suspicious SQL injection patterns for educational analysis
* `POST /api/auth/login-secure`
    * Logs a user in using Prisma's query engine (prepared statements). **Secure.**
    * **Body**: `{ "username": "admin", "password": "password123" }`
    * **Security Features**: HTTP-only secure cookies, login attempt logging

### Comments

* `GET /api/comments`
    * Fetches all comments from the database.
* `POST /api/comments/post-vulnerable`
    * Adds a new comment. **Vulnerable to stored XSS.**
    * **Body**: `{ "content": "<script>alert('XSS!')</script>" }`
    * **Security Features**: Logs suspicious XSS patterns for educational analysis
* `POST /api/comments/post-secure`
    * Adds a new comment after sanitizing input. **Secure.**
    * **Body**: `{ "content": "This is a safe comment." }`
    * **Security Features**: DOMPurify server-side sanitization, XSS attempt logging
* `GET /api/security/logs`
    * Retrieves security event logs for educational analysis
    * **Query Parameters**: `type` (sql_injection, xss_attempt, login_attempt), `minutes` (time filter)

## API Documentation

For detailed API documentation including request/response formats, security features, and test payloads:

* **Comprehensive Documentation**: See [API_DOCUMENTATION.md](./API_DOCUMENTATION.md)
* **Postman Collection**: Import [postman_collection.json](./postman_collection.json) for interactive testing
* **Test Endpoints**: Use the provided collection to test both vulnerable and secure endpoints

### Quick Test Setup
1. Start the development server: `npm run dev`
2. Import the Postman collection from `postman_collection.json`
3. Use the pre-configured requests to test SQL injection and XSS vulnerabilities
4. Monitor security logs at `/api/security/logs`

---

## Security Features Implemented

* **SQL Injection Mitigation**: Use of **Prisma ORM** which relies on **prepared statements** to neutralize SQLi attacks.
* **XSS Mitigation**:
    * **Output Encoding**: React renders text by default, preventing raw HTML from being injected into the DOM.
    * **Content Security Policy (CSP)**: A strict CSP header is set via middleware to block inline scripts and limit script sources.
    * **Server-side Sanitization**: DOMPurify is used in secure endpoints for defense-in-depth protection.
* **Secure Cookies**: HTTP-only, secure, and SameSite cookies for session management.
* **Security Headers**: Comprehensive security headers via Next.js middleware:
    * Content-Security-Policy
    * X-Frame-Options 
    * X-Content-Type-Options
    * Referrer-Policy
    * Permissions-Policy
* **Structured Logging**: All security events (SQLi attempts, XSS attempts, login attempts) are logged with detailed metadata for educational analysis.

## Analytics Setup

The application uses **Google Analytics 4** for tracking educational usage patterns:

* **Tool Used**: react-ga4 library for Google Analytics integration
* **What is Tracked** (anonymized):
    * Vulnerability demonstration attempts (SQL injection, XSS)
    * Security mode toggles (vulnerable â†” secure)
    * Login success/failure rates
    * Comment submission patterns
    * Page views and user interactions

**Privacy**: No sensitive data or personal information is tracked. All analytics focus on educational usage patterns to improve the learning experience.

To enable analytics:
1. Create a Google Analytics 4 property
2. Add your tracking ID to `.env.local`:
   ```
   NEXT_PUBLIC_GA_TRACKING_ID=G-XXXXXXXXXX
   ```
